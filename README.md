_Appium is a tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. It supports iOS native apps written in Objective-C or Swift and Android native apps written in Java or Kotlin. It also supports mobile web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Perform Appium automation tests on [LambdaTest's online cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/appium-mobile-testing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python)._

_Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the LambdaTest platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python)._

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the LambdaTest‚Äôs [LT-appium-python](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritamganguli/proxy_server_parallel/
cd proxy_server_parallel
```

Install the required dependencies by using the following command:

```bash
pip install mitm proxy
pip install selenium==3.12.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Executing The Tests

Basically, first you need to set up the MITM proxy and accept all the certificates for it ( By default it allows only HTTP request)

Download Link: https://mitmproxy.org/




```bash
python3 android.py
```

**IOS:**

```bash
python3 ios.py
```
**Info Note:**
If you are unable to run the automation script with the above mentioned commands try **'python'** command except for **'python3'**.

> Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python).

> If you fail to run the tests, try creating virtual env and installing the dependencies in that environment to run the tests.
> Creating and activating a virtual environment

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
